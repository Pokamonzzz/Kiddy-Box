# Kiddy-Box

This is for my IP project

- Website of the project: https://pokamonzzz.github.io/Kiddy-Box/

I wanted my project to be something related to our childhood so it is called kiddy box where the products are all mostly from our childhood and are not easy to find anymore. So this company sells those snacks and sweets but instead it is in packages. It can be used for events or for birthday parties as goodie bags.

I realised that there are many stalls that does sell traditional snacks but they do not provide packages and delivery. They also do not provide all of the traditional snacks that the customers might be looking for.

## Design Process
I wanted my website to be easy to read and do things in the website. My website is already easy enough to read and move about in the website. I want my customers to be able to easily and quickly buy the products.

- As a designer I want my app/website to be able to attract customer
- As a website developer, I want the website to be able to load smoothly when my customer is using it to buy our products.
- As a parent, I want to be able to buy products that are visually appealing to my children.
- As a customer, I want to be able to choose what kind of snack I want to buy
- As a 3d designer, I want my boxes design to be different

For the wireframe I just came up and did it as i did the coding.
